# GenomeAnalysis

## Aim of project
The aim of this project is to reproduce some of the results from "The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)" by Bin Tean Teh et al.

## Methods
A variety of analyses will be used during the project. These are Canu, Pilon and RepeatMaker for the DNA assembly, Trinity for the RNA assembly, BRAKER for annotation and BWA as well as STAR will be used as aligners.

## Timeline (from the Student Manual checkpoints)
In order to be on track the genome assembly should be done on April 15th, the annotation on April 29th and the RNA mapping on May 4th.

## Data organization
I donâ€™t know how much space I will be needed to store my files, so the plan is to keep files compressed for as long as possible to conserve space. All files used in the project will be stored in my UPPMAX folder. This repository will contain all files besides the data. The files used in the project will be in many different file formats, for example fasta and fastq files.
